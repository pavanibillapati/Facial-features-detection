**Facial Feature Detection using ResNet-18**
This repository contains code for facial feature detection using the ResNet-18 architecture. The model is trained on a facial keypoints dataset and can identify various facial features.

**Overview**
The facial feature detection model implemented here utilizes the ResNet-18 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network. It is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and fine-tuned on a facial keypoints dataset to accurately detect facial features.

**Usage**
**Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/pavanibillapati/Facial-features-detection.git

2. cd facial-feature-detection

3. Run Facial features detection.ipynb
